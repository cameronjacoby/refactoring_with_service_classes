* A class (or method) should have a *single responsibility* ([SOLID Object-Oriented Design](http://confreaks.tv/videos/goruco2009-solid-object-oriented-design) [Sandi Metz])
* A method should be *no longer than 5 lines of code* ([Sandi Metz' Rules For Developers](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers) [thoughtbot])
